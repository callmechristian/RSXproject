# RSX Wireless Sensors Network Project
The project contains a basic user interface to display sensory input from a temperature node and a voltage node through an wireless ethernet gateway node. It is a LabView 2022 project, so running it in older versions of labview requires opening and exporting it in backwards compatibility mode.
