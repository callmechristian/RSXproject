# RSX Wireless Sensors Network Project
The project contains a basic user interface to display sensory input from a temperature node and a voltage node through a wireless ethernet gateway node. It is a LabView 2022 project, so running it in older versions of labview requires opening and exporting it in backwards compatibility mode.

This project was created for the RSX Wireless Sensors and Networks Course by S.-C. Christian and Z. Filippo
